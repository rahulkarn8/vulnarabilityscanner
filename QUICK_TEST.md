# Quick Test Guide - Vulnerable Repositories

## ✅ READY-TO-TEST Repositories with Real Vulnerabilities

### Option 1: Vulnerable Flask App (RECOMMENDED)
```
https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App
```
**Why**: Specifically designed for security testing with Python vulnerabilities

### Option 2: Python Security Examples
```
https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App
```
**Why**: Contains multiple security issues ready to detect

### Option 3: Your Test Repository (BEST)
Push the `test_repo` folder to GitHub:
1. Create new GitHub repository
2. Push test_repo contents
3. Use that URL

## 🚀 Quick Test Steps

1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Enter URL**: `https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App`
3. **Click**: "Analyze Git Repo"
4. **Wait**: For analysis to complete
5. **Review**: All detected vulnerabilities!

## 📊 Expected Results

When testing with vulnerable repositories, you should see:
- **Multiple files** scanned
- **10-50+ vulnerabilities** detected
- **Detailed descriptions** for each issue
- **AI-powered suggestions** for fixes
- **Code examples** showing vulnerable patterns

## ⚠️ Note

Real-world repositories often have fewer vulnerabilities because they're maintained.
For best testing, use:
1. Your test_repo (with 20+ intentional vulnerabilities)
2. Intentionally vulnerable applications like Vulnerable-Flask-App
